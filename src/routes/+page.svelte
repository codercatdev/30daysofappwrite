		#30DaysOfAppwrite is a month long event focussed at giving developers a walkthrough of all of
		<a class="link" href="https://appwrite.io">
			<span class="text">Appwrite's</span>
			<span class="icon-external-link" aria-hidden="true" />
		</a> features, starting from the basics to more advanced features like Cloud Functions! Alongside,
		we will also be building a fully featured Medium Clone to demonstrate how these concepts can be applied
		when building a real world app. We also have some exciting prizes for developers who follow along
		with us!

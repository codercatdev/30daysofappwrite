Phew üòÖ That was one busy week! We just finished our first week of #30DaysOfAppwrite ! Give yourself a pat on the back if you've made it through Week #1. If you haven't gone through the articles already, here's a curated reading list for the weekend üçø

### üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è Pilot
On Day 1, we talked about Appwrite, the [#30DaysOfAppwrite](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-4hh) program and how you can win some cool swags üéÅ as part of the event. 

### ü§© Installation
On [Day 2](https://dev.to/appwrite/installing-appwrite-366o), we learnt about the installation process, hosting your own Appwrite instance, and how to debug some of the most common issues you would face while installing Appwrite. 

### üß± Appwrite‚Äôs building blocks
[Day 3](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-appwrite-s-building-blocks-1936) followed with an in-depth walkthrough of Appwrite's building blocks. We talked in detail about the [docker-compose file](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) that Appwrite uses and all the microservices in the Appwrite Stack. 

### üéõ Appwrite Dashboard
On Day 4, we switched focus to the [Appwrite Dashboard](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-appwrite-dashboard-15cc). We went through all the sections of the dashboard and walked you through all of Appwrite's features! So the next time you're trying to find something, you know exactly where to look! 

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Your first request
Once we were familiar with the Dashboard, it was time to take the next step in the Appwrite learning journey! Making [your first request](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-your-first-request-4oco). On day 5, we learnt to add Flutter and Web Platforms to your project and also made the first request to Appwrite using the Client SDK.

### üîê SSL Certificates
On Day 6 we talked all about [SSL Certificates](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-ssl-certificates-c08) and how appwrite makes it really easy to generate SSL certificates for your domain. 

### üñ• Server Side SDKs
On Day 7, we talked about the differences between the Server and Client Side SDKs and talked about the scenarios where you would use them.

## ‚è≠ What's next ? 
In the coming week, we'll start building our Medium clone. We start with an intro on the Accounts and Users API and implement user login and signup in our demo app. We then enable OAuth providers in the app, followed by enabling SMTP in Appwrite to allow users to perform email verifications and recover passwords. We will end Week #2 by integrating the Teams API, allowing you to create teams, invite members to your teams etc.

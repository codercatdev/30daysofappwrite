Let's face it: building modern apps is hard - building secure, performant, and scalable apps is even harder. We're building [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io) to make app development easier and more fun, and we invite you to join us for `#30DaysofAppwrite`, a month-long event where we all learn and build with Appwrite together.

> TL;DR: We'll be showing off what Appwrite can do in a series of blog posts. If you build with us, we have some cool prizes to give to the best projects at the end.

## Appwhat?

Appwrite is an open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) that provides developers with everything they need to build secure, modern apps fast. Packaged as a set of Docker microservices, Appwrite gives devs a suite of **easy-to-use** APIs, SDKs, tools, and an admin UI to _build features_, not write boilerplate. Local development is as easy as `docker run`.

We've designed Appwrite to be both cross-platform and technology-agnostic, meaning it can run on any operating system, coding language, framework, or platform. Use as much or as little of Appwrite as you need, where you need it - we have [SDKs available](https://appwrite.io/docs/sdks) in multiple programming languages, all generated from the same [source code](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator).

With introductions out of the way, onto the main event.

## #30DaysofAppwrite

Over the next 30 days, we're bringing the entire team together to build a [Medium.com](https://medium.com) clone with Svelte.js and Appwrite. Every day, we'll post a blog that takes a deeper look into the different services needed for our demo blog: user authentication, data storage, file uploads, cloud functions, and more! A detailed timeline of the month-long event can be found [on our website](https://30days.appwrite.io).

> We've built demo Appwrite-powered apps using many popular web frameworks - check out the growing list on [our awesome GitHub repository](https://github.com/appwrite/awesome-appwrite#showcase-built-with-appwrite-) to get started.

By the end of the month, we will have created a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on building apps in Appwrite (and a blog site, too). For those building apps alongside us during #30DaysofAppwrite, we want to see your progress! Share your work with us on Twitter, Dev.to, or LinkedIn with the hashtag `#30DaysofAppwrite` or in the `30DaysofAppwrite` channel on [Discord](https://appwrite.io/discord).

## Building With Us

If you build something cool as a part of `#30DaysofAppwrite`, we want to show our appreciation! From now until June 5th, build and submit your coolest projects powered by Appwrite. Afterwards, we will pick the winners for some awesome prizes! To participate, showcase your projects by:

- Sharing on social media with `#30DaysofAppwrite`
- Opening a Pull Request on [appwrite/awesome-appwrite](https://github.com/appwrite/awesome-appwrite) with your work

Submissions will be eligible for an Appwrite T-shirt and Stickers. The top `#30DaysofAppwrite` projects will be rewarded with Raspberry Pi 4 kits!

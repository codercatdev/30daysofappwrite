It's a wrap! Week 2 of #30daysOfAppwrite is now officially over! We learnt so much during this week that its hard to talk about everything here! So here's a quick summary and links to the original posts if you would like to learn more. Grab some üçø popcorn and read along!

### üë¶ Accounts & Users API

On Day 8, we introduced you all to the [Accounts and Users API](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-accounts-users-api-4592). We talked about the key differences between them and when you should use which. We also talked about how the User's API is a server API and the Accounts API is a client API. We also made some sample requests to show you how you can quickly get started with them!

### ü§© Login and Sign Up

On [Day 9](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-login-and-signup-2957), we built upon what we learnt the previous day and implemented Login and Sign Up functionality in our [demo app](https://github.com/christyjacob4/30-days-of-appwrite)!

### üöÄ OAuth Providers

[Day 10](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-oauth-providers-3jf6) followed with the integration of Google OAuth in our app. Google is one of the 24+ OAuth providers(!) that Appwrite supports, most of which were contributed by our community! Huge shout to all of you!! If we're missing your favourite OAuth Provider, feel free to [follow our guide](https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/blob/master/docs/tutorials/add-oauth2-provider.md) to learn how to add new providers to Appwrite!

### üìß Getting Started with SMTP

On Day 11, we switched focus to [SMTP](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-getting-started-with-smtp-1e2e). Appwrite allows you to easily integrate 3rd party SMTP providers like SendGrid, Mailgun and more in just a few easy steps üôÇ. This is extremely useful if you would like to send verification emails or allow users to reset their passwords.

### üîê Email Verification and Forgot Password

We built upon what we learnt on Day 11 to add support for [Email Verification and Password Resets](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-email-verification-and-forgot-password-420o) in our demo app. With each new feature, were getting closer to our goal of building a Medium clone!

### üë®‚Äçüë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß Appwrite Teams

Day 13 was all about [Appwrite's Teams API](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-appwrite-teams-2fjd). We learnt how you can easily group users into teams and manage permissions across Appwrite's resources like documents, collections, files, and functions.

### üì® Using Team Invites

On Day 14, we added a lot of [teams functionality](https://dev.to/appwrite/30daysofappwrite-using-team-invites-gk1) in our demo app. You can now create teams, invite members to your team, manage the members of your team and much more! Take a look at [this PR](https://github.com/christyjacob4/30-days-of-appwrite/pull/4) to see exactly what we added.

## ‚è≠ What's next ?

In the coming week, we'll explore Appwrite's Database API and go over all the steps to define new collections and create documents. We will talk about some Appwrite specific lingo like `attributes`,`permissions`, `labels`, `keys` etc. and make sure you have a solid understanding of the database. We will build functionality to create a user profile and also allow the user to create Blog Posts on our Medium clone! We will then take a look at Appwrite's storage API. This is where we allow users to upload cover images for their blog posts. To wrap it up, we will take a look at the Avatars API and allow users to share their blog posts using QR codes. It's gonna be an exciting week ahead! So stay tuned üìª!
